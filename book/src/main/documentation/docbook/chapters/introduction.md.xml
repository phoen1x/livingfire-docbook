    As a software engineer I love to work with source code that comes
    with Unit Tests and a well written documentation. Markdown is surely
    a good way to write your documents. But sometimes it comes in handy
    to have a shiny PDF to store offline, send via email or print in
    high resolution. For those cases Docbook (co-founder
    <ulink url="https://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Media</ulink>) is a
    good solution because it supports different output formats like pdf,
    epub or html. My project
    <ulink url="https://gitlab.com/phoen1x/livingfire-docbook">livingfire-docbook</ulink>
    shows a easy way to get started with Docbook and alter this
    <ulink url="https://gitlab.com/phoen1x/livingfire-docbook/raw/master/book.pdf">example</ulink>
    for your own needs. The software can also covert Markdown to Docbook
    using <ulink url="http://pandoc.org/">pandoc</ulink> and combine
    multiple Markdown files like a GitLab Wiki into one PDF. In addtion
    to that you can write UML diagrams in
    <ulink url="http://plantuml.com/">PlantUML</ulink> and have them
    rendered into pictures in your book.
